                    <p>Bacon Q. Dog is a 9yr old labradoodle. He prefers to spend his days lounging among the three different beds/couches that his family has gifted him. He enjoys a walk or two around the neighborhood, as long as he can pretend that he doesn't see any of the other animals to avoid the embarrassment of not wanting to admit he has no wolf-like skills in chasing them.</p> 
                    <P>At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon suddenly wants to release all of his energy. He will place his toys on a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving his toys "a ride." There is also a lot of rolling. Lots and lots of rolling.</P>

                        doggie friends. If lucky enough, he might see the cyclist, but he is not allowed to give chase.

                        With a coat as dark as midnight but eyes as bright as stars, 
                        he seemed to embody both the mystery and the exuberance of life itself. 
                        Agile and playful, he danced around the park as if the grass were his personal stage, 
                        captivating everyone with his vivacity.

                        Yet, when at home, Chako transformed into a zen master. 
                        He would curl up on his favorite rug, eyes half-closed in contemplation, 
                        as if solving the great puzzles of the universe. Both spirited and serene, 
                        Mochi was a living testament to the richness of dualities, 
                        teaching his human companions that one could be many things all at once.
